# Life With COVID
Life With COVID is a project aimed at providing users with valuable information about COVID, its origins and practical ways to navigate life during the pandemic.

## Design Process
Our website is designed to offer users a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19, including links to certified websites, essential information, and helpful hotlines for queries. The design aims to provide both basic knowledge and the opportunity for users to explore further if desired.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to find useful and verified resources for understanding the origins of COVID-19.
As a user, I want access to hotlines for any queries related to COVID-19.
As a user, I want to see useful data on the COVID Situation in other countries.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:
Go to the "SignUp Form" page.
Try to submit the empty form and verify the appearance of an error message about the required fields.
Attempt to submit the form with an invalid email address and confirm the display of a relevant error message.
Submit the form with all inputs valid and verify the appearance of a success message.
