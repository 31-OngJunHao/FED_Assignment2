# Life With COVID
This project is to give useful information to users who want to find out more on COVID, its origins and how we can live with it in a visually appealing way.

## Design Process
Our websites provides useful information such as links to certified websites, useful information, helpful hotlines for any queries, to give users not only a basic understanding of covid, but also a chance to find out more information if they want to.

### User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

### Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

### JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
